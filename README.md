# Nifty50_Closing-Prediction
In this project I have attempted to predict the closing of Nifty 50 index.
The NIFTY 50 is a benchmark Indian stock market index that represents the weighted average of 50 of the largest Indian companies listed on the National Stock Exchange.
I have gathered this dataset from the official NSE site https://www.nseindia.com/. Futrther, I have made a few changes in the dataset and attempted to predict the closing value based on other attributs like open, high, low, etc.
